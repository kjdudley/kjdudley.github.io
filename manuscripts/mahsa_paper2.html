Fodders with different quality may affect the composition of the
microbial communities that colonise and degrade fodder particles in the
rumen. In this study, low-quality fodder (sugarcane bagasse) and
high-quality fodder (Lucerne hay) were incubated in the bovine rumen and
the kinetics of dry matter, neutral detergent fibre, and acid detergent
fibre digestion were determined. Further, the structure of the
planktonic bacterial community and the sessile bacterial communities
colonising sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay were characterised using
full-length 16S rRNA PacBio sequencing. Digestion of sugarcane bagasse
and Lucerne hay occurred in three (rapid, intermediate, and slow
digestion) and four (solubilisation, rapid digestion, slow digestion,
and plateau) phases, respectively, in the bovine rumen and each phase
was characterised by distinct sessile bacterial communities. The
relatively rapid phase of sugarcane bagasse digestion was accompanied by
bacteria from the <i>Christensenellaceae R-7 group</i>, <i>Prevotella 1</i>,
<i>Ruminococcus 1</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut group, and <i>Lachnospiraceae
XPB1014 group</i>, genera. The intermediate digestion phase of sugarcane
bagasse was accompanied by a shift in bacterial taxa in which
<i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut group, <i>Fibrobacter</i>, <i>Saccharofermentans</i>, and
<i>Treponema 2</i> were enriched. The slow digestion phase in which the rate
of NDF digestion decreased significantly was accompanied by decrease in
abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i>, <i>Prevotella 1</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus 1</i>.
Digestion of Lucerne hay occurred in three phases: (i) a solubilisation
phase (4 h) in which <i>Christensenellaceae R-7 group</i>, <i>Butyrivibrio 2</i>,
<i>Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group</i>, and <i>Prevotella 1</i> were the most
abundant bacteria, (ii) a rapid digestion phase (8 &#x2013; 12 h) during which
relative abundance of <i>Treponema 2</i> and <i>Anaeroplasma</i> increased, (iii)
a slow digestion phase (12 - 32 h) in which <i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut
group, <i>Saccharofermentans</i>, and <i>Fibrobacter</i> enriched, and (iv) a
plateau phase (&gt;32 h) in which <i>Ruminococcus 1</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae
XPB1014 group</i>, and decreased significantly in abundance, and A
comparison of bacterial communities adherent to sugarcane bagasse and
Lucerne hay revealed that the abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i>,
<i>Saccharofermentans</i>, <i>Butyrivibrio 2</i>, and <i>Anaeroplasma</i> differed
significantly between fodders. This study demonstrated a strong
interaction between the digestion of sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay,
and the composition of the fodder-adherent bacterial community. This
study also demonstrated that planktonic bacterial communities did not
change significantly during the period.

The global demand for animal products is projected to increase by <a href="#orgf5e749d">60-70%</a><label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

in 2050 due to human population growth; hence, additional fodder
will be required to meet the projected increased demand for animal
products. However, fodder production is challenged by food-feed
competition, land degradation, and climate change. In addition, fodder
ingredients with high protein and soluble carbohydrate content are
relatively expensive and compete directly or indirectly with food
production (Ahmadi et al. 2016, Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al. 2018).
Fodder can represent up to 70% of cattle production costs and the
identification of more cost-effective fodder ingredients is timely
because of both market and environmental factors (Ahmadi et al. 2016,
Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al. 2018, McGrath et al. 2018). Thus,
low-quality fodders, including crop processing by-products (<i>e.g.</i>,
sugarcane bagasse), will become increasingly important in the animal
production sector; but there is limited information describing the
direct comparison of digestion and colonisation of low- and high-quality
fodders in the rumen.

<p>
The rumen is the first and largest of the <a href="#org04f395e">stomach compartments in</a><label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

ruminants, and harbours a highly diverse, complex community of obligate
anaerobic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Rumen microorganisms
work synergistically to break down and convert fodder particles into
volatile fatty acids and microbial biomass, key sources of energy and
protein for ruminants, respectively (Mizrahi et al. 2021). The microbial
community in the rumen enables efficient fodder digestion and strongly
influences fodder intake in ruminants. Bacteria are the dominant
microorganisms in the rumen microbial community and make the largest
contribution to the breakdown of fodder particles (Moraïs and Mizrahi
2019). Fodder particle-associated bacteria account for 70 &#x2014; 80% of the
total ruminal bacteria population and produce most of the enzymes for
the digestion of fodders in ruminants (Liu et al. 2016). The attachment
and colonisation of rumen bacteria to fodder particles is essential for
the establishment of the complex microbial community required for their
breakdown (Liu et al. 2016). <a href="#org1ffd1dd">Therefore, understanding the mechanism of bacterial attachment and the relationship between fodder digestion and colonisation by rumen bacteria is the stepping stone for the development of methods to increase fodder use efficiency in ruminants through adding feed additives such as enzymes and probiotics and thermochemical pretreatment of low-quality fodders (Mizrahi and Jami 2018, Du et al.2019, Moraïs and Mizrahi 2019, Firkins 2021).</a><label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<a href="#org4d24e54">It was previously shown that microbial colonisation of fodder particles in the rumen</a><label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Changed from: Microbial colonisation of fodder particles in the rumen
</span> involves three
main steps; (i) displacement of the epiphytic microbial community by
rumen microorganisms (&lt;1 h incubation), (ii) establishment of a primary
colonising community of generalist microorganisms that metabolise
accessible carbohydrates (1 &#x2013; 4 h incubation), and (iii) formation of a
secondary colonising community of specialist microorganisms that digest
cellulose and hemicellulose (&gt;4 h incubation) (Terry et al. 2020). The
composition of the bacterial communities colonising high and low-quality
fodders, including alfalfa hay, barley, rice, and wheat straws and corn
stover, during <i>in situ</i> incubation changes significantly over time and
fodder digestion is dependent on the establishment of primary- and
secondary-colonising microbial communities (Liu et al. 2016, Cheng et
al. 2017, Jin et al. 2018, Terry et al. 2020). While the temporal
changes in the bacterial communities adherent to fodder particles during
incubation in the rumen is well understood, information about changes in
the composition of microbial communities colonising fodder particles of
fodder types with different quality and its correlation with changes in
the chemical composition of fodder during incubation in the rumen is
still limited. Differences in the composition of microbial communities
colonising fodders with different quality can cause shifts in the
microbial metabolic networks which ultimately can affect the <a href="#org5a16fd6">Dry matter (DM)</a><label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

digestibility, rate of short-chain fatty acids and methane production,
feed intake, and daily body weight gain in ruminants (Cammack et al.
2018, Snelling et al. 2019).
</p>

<p>
Maintaining the productivity of ruminant livestock depends upon factors
that influence the rumen microbiome, including fodder type, composition,
quality, and quantity (Lengowski et al. 2016). Fodder type is well-known
as the principal factor affecting rumination time, <a href="#org66b5d61">rumen fermentation</a><label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span>,
and ruminant performance and productivity (Liu et al. 2016). Bagasse,
the main sugar industry by-product, is the lignocellulosic fibre, mostly
composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, that remains after the
extraction of sugar juice from sugarcane stalk and has low soluble sugar
and protein contents (Harrison 2016). Despite the relative abundance
(~10 Mt p.a. in Australia) and relatively low cost of this low-quality
fodder, sugarcane bagasse is only used as an emergency livestock feed.
In contrast, Lucerne hay is a high-quality fodder that is used worldwide
as a component of the ruminant livestock diet (Liu et al. 2016).
Sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay are known to differ in chemical
composition, physical structure, and subsequently DM digestibility in
the rumen (Pinos-Rodríguez et al. 2002, Harrison 2016, Liu et al. 2016,
So et al. 2020). The DM digestibility of dried and ground sugarcane
bagasse and Lucerne hay were 30% and 73%, respectively after 48 h of
incubation in the rumen (Vitti et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2016). However,
there is limited information about the differences in the bacterial
community that are involved in the breakdown and colonisation of the
fibrous component of sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay. In addition,
most of the previous studies have only investigated the effect of
incubation time on the composition of bacterial communities colonising
fodder particles.
</p>

<p>
The kinetics of digestion and composition of the bacterial community
adherent to rice straw and alfalfa hay during <i>in situ</i> incubation in
nonlactating Holstein cows have been characterised and compared (Liu et
al. 2016). Alfalfa hay had significantly higher DM disappearance and NDF
digestibility compared to rice straw during <i>in situ</i> incubation in the
rumen. After 2 and 6 h of incubation in the rumen, alfalfa hay had a
significantly higher relative abundance of <i>Butyrivibrio</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>,
while bacteria from the genera unclassified/ Rikenellaceae/,
unclassified/ Bacteroidales/, and unclassified /Ruminococcaceae/ were
more abundant in the rice straw samples. However, after 16 and 48 h of
incubation, the relative abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i> was significantly
higher on rice straw, while <i>Anaeroplasma</i> and unclassified
<i>Bacteroidales</i> were more abundant on the surface of alfalfa hay
relative to rice straw (Liu et al. 2016).
</p>

<p>
In this study, we digested sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay in the
bovine rumen for 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, and 72 h, and
measured dry matter, neutral detergent fibre, and acid detergent fibre
digestion. Full-length 16S PacBio sequencing was used to characterise
the bacterial community on the surface of the fodder particles and in
the planktonic bacterial community at each timepoint. This approach
enabled us to compare temporal changes in the bacterial communities on
fodder particles with very different compositions and nutritional
content in a common environment. Further, we were able to investigate
temporal relationships between the planktonic bacterial community and
the bacterial community adherent to the fodder particles during
digestion. Understanding the relationship between the structural and
chemical composition of fodder, the kinetics of fodder digestion, and
bacterial colonisation in the rumen is central to the development of
strategies to enhance the digestibility of sugarcane bagasse.

Fodder samples were dried at 45 °C for 48 h and milled using a Retsch
SM100 hammer mill (Retsch GmBH, Germany) fitted with a 2 mm sieve. Water
extractives were removed from the milled fodder using a Dionex ASE 350
and the biomass composition of extractive-free fodder was determined
using the NREL method (Sluiter et al. 2008). Briefly, extractive-free
fodder samples were transferred to pressure tubes (Ace Glass
Incorporated, USA), an aliquot (3 mL) of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (72% (w/v)) was
added to each tube, and the mixtures were incubated in a water bath at
30 °C for 60 min with mixing via a stirring rod every 10 min. The tubes
were removed from the water bath and 4 mL of ultrapure water was added
to each tube. Sugar recovery standard was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g
D-glucose (≥99.5%), 0.07 g D-xylose (≥99%), 0.02 g D-galactose (≥99%),
and 0.02 g D-arabinose (≥98%) in 100 mL of water. The pressure tubes and
sugar recovery standard were autoclaved at 115 °C for 60 min. The tubes
were then cooled to room temperature and the hydrolysate was filtered
using pre-weighed filtering crucibles. The filtrate was collected for
the quantification of mono- and di-saccharides. The absorbance at 240 nm
of a sub-sample of the filtrate was measured using a UV-Visible
spectrophotometer (Cary 60 UV-Vis, Agilent Technologies) and used to
quantify acid-soluble lignin (ASL) content. The filtering crucibles
containing unhydrolysed solids were dried at 105 °C for 24 h, heated in
muffle furnace (C.T Moloney Pty. Ltd., Sydney) at 575 ± 25 °C for 4 h,
and the mass of the residue was measured to quantify acid-insoluble
lignin (AIL) content. Monomeric sugars were quantified using a HPLC
system (Waters) equipped with a refractive index detector (Waters 410,
US) and a SP810 carbohydrate column (300 mm × 8.0 mm, Shodex, Japan).
The column temperature was 85 °C and water was used as the mobile phase
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. The concentrations of monomeric
sugars in the acid hydrolysate were used to calculate the amounts of
cellulose and hemicellulose in the original biomass sample.
</p>

<p>
NDF and ADF analyses were carried out using an ANKOM 200 Fibre Analyser
according to the manufacturer's methodology. Briefly, fodder samples
(0.45 &#x2014; 0.5 g, dried at 45 °C and milled through a 2 mm screen) were
transferred to ANKOM bags and then placed in the fibre analyser chamber.
NDF solution (100 mL per bag), 8.0 mL of α-amylase enzyme solution, and
sodium sulphate (0.5 g per 50 mL of NDF solution) were added to the
chamber. Samples were incubated and agitated in NDF solution at 100 °C
for 75 min followed by three rinse steps with distilled water at 70 &#x2013;
90 °C for 5 min. Samples were air-dried overnight, dried in an oven at
105 °C for a maximum of 4 h, and then weighed. Subsequently, samples
were added to the vessel and incubated in ADF solution at 100 °C for 60
min and then rinsed with 70 &#x2013; 90 ℃ deionised water in the vessel with
agitation until the samples were neutralised. Bags of samples were
air-dried, incubated in an oven at 105 °C for 2-4 h, and then weighed.
</p>

<p>
Elemental analysis was used to quantify the nitrogen content in the
fodder samples. Fodder samples were dried at 45 °C until their weight
was constant and milled using a Retsch SM100 hammer mill fitted with a 2
mm sieve. Samples were ground using tube mill (IKA, 4180001) and then
analysed for C, N, and S content method using the LECO TruMac Carbon
Nitrogen Sulphur elemental macro analyser (TruMac® CNS, LECO
Corporation, USA). The nitrogen content (g 100 g<sup>-1</sup>) in fodder samples
was used to determine their crude protein content (nitrogen content ×
6.25 = crude protein).

The <i>in situ</i> rumen incubation of fodder samples was approved by the
animal ethics committees of the University of Queensland and Queensland
University of Technology. Fodder samples were dried at 45 °C for 48 h,
ground using a Retsch SM100 hammer mill (Retsch GmBH, Germany) fitted
with a 2 mm screen, and passed over a 53 µm screen. Sub-samples of
fodder (~5 g) retained on the screen were transferred into polyester
bags with a pore size of 48 µm (Allied Filter Fabrics Corp, Australia)
and placed in the rumen of steers at the Gatton campus of the University
of Queensland. Two fistulated steers were used to characterise bacterial
colonisation of fodder. The <i>Bos indicus</i> steers were fed on green couch
grass and sorghum hay as supplement <i>ad libitum</i>. Each steer hosted 60

genes were generated for each sample using universal primers 27F
(5'-AGRGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG -3') and 1492R (5'- RGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT -3')
containing a PacBio universal sequence overhang. PCR amplification was
performed in an Eppendorf Thermal Cycler (Germany) using 2.5 ng of
template DNA (2.5 ng µL<sup>-1</sup>), 0.75 µL of each primer (10 µM), and 12.5
µL of KAPA HiFi Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney,
Australia). The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 20 cycles
of 95 °C for 30 sec, 57 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 60 sec and held at

used to visualise the sequencing data (Andersen et al. 2018).
</p>

<p>
The α-diversity metrics were conducted using Shannon's diversity index
and Observed ASVs (Shannon and Weaver 1949, DeSantis et al. 2006). A
Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to analyse the
differences between treatment groups for diversity indices. The
<i>P</i>-values were adjusted according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The
principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using Bray&#x2013;Curtis
distance metrics to visualise differences in bacterial communities
between timepoints, phases of digestion, and fodder types. The overall
and pairwise significance between different groups were analysed using a
Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) in R vegan
package (Dixon 2003).

<p>
The significant differences in the kinetics of digestion of sugarcane
bagasse and Lucerne hay during incubation in the bovine rumen and
changes in the taxa abundances between timepoints and phases of
digestion were evaluated in R. The normality and homogeneity of
variances were tested using D'agostino-Pearson and Levene's tests,
respectively. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for
independent samples and pairwise comparisons were performed with the
Dunn's post-hoc test and <i>P</i>-values were adjusted using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method. Statistical significance was declared when
/P/≤0.05. These analyses were conducted in R using fBasics (Wuertz et
al. 2020), and FSA (Ogle et al. 2021) packages. The overall significant
differences in the bacterial communities between fodders were evaluated
using the Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes with Bias Correction
(ANCOM-BC) package (Mandal et al. 2015) in R and <i>P</i>-values were
adjusted using the Holm&#x2013;Bonferroni method.

Bagasse is the fibrous residue remaining after sugarcane (<i>Saccharum
officinarum</i>) stalk billets are processed in a mill to extract sugar
juice. The goal of commercial sugarcane milling is to rupture every cell
in the stalk billet and release the maximum amount of sugar juice. In
contrast, Lucerne (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) hay is harvested, dried, and baled
without significant cell disruption. The difference in cell disruption
during processing is apparent in the composition of the two fodders
(Table 1). The NDF and ADF content in sugarcane bagasse was
significantly higher than those of Lucerne hay (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) but
sugarcane bagasse contained significantly less crude protein and ash
than that of Lucerne hay (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the significant
differences in extractives, crude protein, and ash contents, the
cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents in sugarcane bagasse and
Lucerne hay fibres were similar.

sequencing. DNA was extracted from sugarcane bagasse, Lucerne hay, and
rumen fluid at each timepoint during digestion. 16S rRNA gene sequencing
of all samples generated 2,122,602 CCS reads and 85,403 ASVs, with an
average of 11,012 ± 2,054 and 3,425 ± 655 ASVs per sample. The total

The kinetics of α-diversity of bacterial communities on sugarcane

A comparison of α-diversity of bacterial communities adherent to

significantly between rapid and slow digestion phases (<i>P</i> = 0.02), and
then did not change between slow digestion and plateau phases of

communities colonising sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay revealed that
no significant difference between the diversity of bacterial communities
adherent to sugarcane bagasse and lucerne during rapid fibre digestion

lucerne hay (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The correlation between the α-diversity of
bacterial community adherent to sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay and
NDF digestibility revealed that increasing NDF digestibility of
sugarcane bagasse was correlated to a decrease in bacterial diversity,
while the bacterial complexity associated with Lucerne hay increased
with increasing NDF digestibility (Figure S1).

The planktonic bacterial communities at each incubation time of
sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay in the bovine rumen were characterised
and compared to explore if any changes occurred in the composition of
planktonic bacterial community during the incubation of sugarcane
bagasse and Lucerne hay had any impact on the fodder-associated
bacterial community. (Figure 7). The most abundant planktonic bacterial
phyla in the rumen fluid were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and their
relative abundance did not change significantly between sampling time
points (Figure S5). The dominant bacterial genera in the rumen fluid
samples include <i>Prevotella 1</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut group,
<i>Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group</i>, <i>Christensenellaceae R-7 group</i>,
uncultured bacterium in the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family, uncultured rumen
bacterium in the <i>Bacteroidales BS11 gut group</i> family, <i>Butyrivibrio

<a href="#org88fe6f9">Understanding the composition of rumen microbial communities that colonise and proliferate on the surface of fodder particles is essential for understanding fodder digestion. It can ultimately lead to the development of novel methods to increase nutrient use efficiency in ruminants and improve animal productivity (Du et al. 2019). However, only limited studies have investigated the microbial community associated with fodder particles along the kinetics of fodder digestion in the bovine rumen. A comparison of microbial communities that colonise and degrade low- and high-quality fodders provides an opportunity to determine (i) diversity of bacterial communities that colonise low- and high-quality fodders in the bovine rumen, (ii) if the fibre-degrading microbial community in the rumen varies with the source of the fibre, (iii) if the microbial community degrading fibres in the rumen at different phases of fibre digestion vary with the source of fibre, and (iv) whether microbial communities that persist on fibres after fibre digestion has reached a maximum vary with the source of fibre.</a><label for="31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="31" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Lucerne hay contains 50 &#x2013; 70% non-lignocellulosic components including proteins, non-structural carbohydrates, and minerals which are readily digestible by a wide range of rumen microorganisms. Sugarcane bagasse is composed of gt90% lignocellulose and is degraded by a complex microbial community with cellulolytic activity in the rumen (Pinos-Rodríguez et al. 2002, Guilherme et al. 2015, Harrison 2016, Liu et al. 2016, Moraïs and Mizrahi 2019).</a><label for="33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="33" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<a href="#org7dcf8da">The differences in the chemical composition of sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay significantly affected the kinetics of digestion during incubation in the rumen. The kinetics of DM, NDF, and ADF digestion in sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay appeared to be multiphasic. The degradation kinetics of sugarcane bagasse by rumen microorganisms consisted of (i) a rapid digestion phase during which a significant increase in DM, NDF, and ADF digestibility was observed, (ii) an intermediate phase during which the degradation rate decreased, and (iii) a slow degradation phase during which the degradation rate decreased significantly and easily accessible nutrients from the fodder has been consumed. Compared with the sugarcane bagasse, the DM, NDF, and ADF digestibility of Lucerne hay consisted of four phases; including (i) a solubilisation phase in which an initial significant DM loss with no significant corresponding NDF and ADF digestibility in Lucerne hay samples occurred, (ii) a rapid digestion phase during which a significant DM, NDF and ADF digestibility occurred, (iii) a slow digestion phase with a significant decrease in the rate of degradation, and (v) a plateau phase during which no significant DM, NDF, and ADF digestibility was occurred</a>.<label for="34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="34" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<p>
Previous studies on rice straw, alfalfa hay, and wheat straw have
demonstrated that the degradation kinetics of fodders in the rumen is
multiphasic. The kinetics of fibre degradation in wheat straw, rice
straw, and switchgrass consists of three phases; (i) relatively rapid DM
degradation (~10%) within 0.5 &#x2013; 1 h of incubation, (ii) a latent phase
during which no significant fibre digestion occurred (between 1 h and 4
&#x2013; 6 h), and (iii) a continuous fibre degradation phase between 4 &#x2013; 6 h
and 72 h (Moraïs and Mizrahi 2019). In another study, the degradation
kinetics of rice straw and alfalfa hay by rumen microorganisms was
investigated. Rice straw was rapidly digested after 0.5 h of incubation
in the rumen followed by a degradation phase (0.5 &#x2013; 48 h) during which
DM of rice straw was digested with a relatively constant rate. DM
degradation of alfalfa hay occurred in three phases including (i) an
initial rapid DM digestion (0.5 h of incubation), (ii) a degradation
phase during which NDF and crude protein were mainly digested (6 &#x2013; 16
h), and (iii) a degradation phase in which the rate of DM degradation
decreased (16 &#x2013; 48 h) (Liu et al. 2016). The kinetics of DM, NDF, and
ADF degradation of Lucerne hay was consistent with those observed with
alfalfa hay except for the plateau phase which is likely due to longer
incubation of Lucerne hay (72 h) in the rumen than alfalfa hay (48 h).
The kinetics of DM, NDF, and ADF degradation of sugarcane bagasse did
not include a latent phase which is likely due to the first
post-incubation timepoint of 4 h instead of 0.5 &#x2013; 1 h. In addition, the
kinetics of NDF degradation of sugarcane bagasse consisted of three
degradation phases with different rates of degradation which is likely
because of longer incubation (72 h) in the rumen compared to rice straw
(48 h). <a href="#org25e95e2">While the kinetics of degradation of sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay in the rumen were consistent with those obtained with rice, barley, and wheat straws, alfalfa hay, and switchgrass, a large number of incubation timepoints used in the present study has provided additional phases of digestion for sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay.</a><label for="35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="35" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Extra timepoints analysed in this study provided novel insight into phases of digestion that had not previously been observed. This is the key takeaway point and I'm not sure the detail provided before this is necessary to include. Just point the reader to the relevant references

</p>

<p>
The present study aimed to understand the relationship between the
degradation phases and dynamics of bacterial communities colonising
sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay in the bovine rumen. Previous studies
have demonstrated that bacterial communities colonising fodder particles
in the rumen are affected by incubation time and the temporal changes in
the adherent microbial communities are associated with DM digestibility
of fodders (Liu et al. 2016, Cheng et al. 2017, Jin et al. 2018). The
bacterial communities on rice straw separated into two clusters based on
incubation time; including (i) 0.5 h and 6 h, and (ii) 24 h and 48 h.
Another study on barley straw and corn stover demonstrated that
bacterial communities colonising barley straw and corn stover at 48 h of
incubation were distinct from those at 2 &#x2013; 8 h of incubation. The
bacterial communities on rice straw and alfalfa hay were shifted
significantly after 0.5 h of incubation in the rumen and after 16 &#x2013; 48
h compared to 0.5 h. It has been suggested that the two degradation
phases of fodders might correspond to (i) a first cluster of bacterial
community that are involved in degradation of accessible amorphous
regions of the fibre, and (ii) a secondary bacterial group that have
potential crystalline cellulose-degrading capability (Moraïs and Mizrahi
2019). <a href="#orgf91a08a">The present study confirms that incubation time has a significant impact on the fodder-associated bacterial communities, and there is a relationship between the DM, NDF, and ADF digestibility of sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay particles and dynamics of bacterial communities colonising sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay in the bovine rumen.</a><label for="36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="36" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<p>
<a href="#org66c5c5b">The initial rapid degradation phase of sugarcane bagasse was accompanied by bacterial taxa that play a significant role in plant fibre degradation. <i>Ruminococcus</i> spp. are well-known for their ability to metabolise cellulose and hemicellulose by secreting cellulases, hemicellulases, and other oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes, and produce succinate, formate, and acetate (Flint et al. 2008, Khatoon et al. 2021). <i>Prevotella</i> is one of the most abundant genera in the rumen which has an important role in lignocellulose degradation. Members of <i>Prevotella</i> are significantly involved in the metabolism of starch, cellulose, xylan, pectin, and crude protein and produce acetate, propionate, and succinate (Jin et al. 2018, Zhu et al. 2021). <i>Christensenellaceae R-7 group</i> were consistently abundant on the surface of sugarcane bagasse during the incubation in the rumen; however, their role in the rumen is still unknown (Yang et al. 2020). <i>Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group</i> spp. are found to be involved in the degradation of structural carbohydrates (Zhou et al. 2021). The adhesion of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and unclassified <i>Rikenellaceae</i> has previously been reported on the surface of rice straw and alfalfa hay (Liu et al. 2016).</a><label for="37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="37" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
This paragraph basically says that your findings are in agreement with what is already known. That's fine. But is there anything about your particular dataset that is novel? E.g. any novel species-level observation that made use of long Pacbio reads?

<p>
<a href="#orga058928">The bacterial communities adherent to sugarcane bagasse particles in the intermediate degradation phase were significantly less diverse and were distinct compared to those in the initial degradation phase as demonstrated by the alpha and beta diversity, respectively. A significant decrease in the rate of NDF and ADF degradation of sugarcane bagasse in the second degradation phase was accompanied by a significant decrease in the abundance of <i>Prevotella 1</i> and <i>Ruminococcus 1</i>, and a significant increase in the relative abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut group, <i>Saccharofermentans</i>, and <i>Treponema 2</i>. <i>Fibrobacter</i>, a well-studied rumen bacteria, has high activity against crystalline cellulose and is able to solubilise complex plant cell wall polysaccharides (Terry et al. 2020). It is reported that <i>Treponema</i> and <i>Fibrobacter</i> synergistically work together; <i>Treponema</i> is likely benefiting from the cross-feeding network created by <i>Fibrobacter</i> (Xie et al. 2018). The increased abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i> and <i>Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group</i> during the intermediate digestion phase may reflect the increased accessibility of cellulose occurred as a result of removal of cell wall matrix earlier in the rapid degradation phase. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of <i>Fibrobacter</i> and <i>Treponema</i> on rice straw, alfalfa, corn stover, barley straw, wheat straw, and switchgrass in the secondary colonising bacterial community (after 16 - 48 h of incubation) (Piao et al. 2014, Liu et al. 2016, Jin et al. 2018, Terry et al. 2020). The genus <i>Saccharofermentans</i> has only one known species which is unable to degrade cellulose but can ferment glucose, sucrose, fructose, cellobiose, starch and produce acetate as the main end-product, and their abundance has been previously reported on rice straw, alfalfa hay, wheat straw, and perennial ryegrass (Huws et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2016, Cheng et al. 2017, Jin et al. 2018, Dai et al. 2021). The increased abundance of this genus might be due to utilisation of released sugars from cellulose degradation. The decrease in diversity and observed shift in bacterial taxa in the intermediate degradation phase reveals that bacterial specialists that can degrade recalcitrant structural carbohydrates become more abundant. These observations are consistent with rumen-incubated alfalfa hay and rice straw samples; Bacteria with more fibre-degrading role such as <i>Fibrobacter</i>, <i>Treponema</i>, unclassified <i>Bacteroidales</i>, and unclassified <i>Rikenellaceae</i> were enriched during the second degradation phase (16 &#x2013; 48 h) (Liu et al. 2016).</a><label for="38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="38" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<a href="#org1db5a92">The slow degradation phase of sugarcane bagasse was accompanied by a significant decrease in the relative abundance of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Fibrobacter</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus 1</i>. Previous study has revealed that the abundance of unclassified <i>Rikenellaceae</i> and unclassified <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> has a positive correlation with NDF content and consequently these bacteria play a significant role in the degradation of low-quality fodders such as rice straw (Liu et al. 2016). The abundance of <i>Rikenellaceae RC9</i> gut group, <i>Saccharofermentans</i>, and <i>Treponema 2</i> in the slow degradation phase might be due to utilisation of degradation metabolites. The dynamic changes in the structure and chemical composition of fodders during incubation might change the input and output metabolites and create niche modification that subsequently can cause shifts in microbial communities.</a><label for="39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="39" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

There was no significant NDF and ADF digestion during the solubilisation phase of Lucerne hay&gt;&gt; and <i>Christensenellaceae R-7 group</i>, <i>Butyrivibrio 2</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group</i>, and <i>Prevotella 1</i> were the most abundant bacterial genera in the microbial community on the surface of Lucerne hay particles. <i>Butyrivibrio</i> is the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the rumen and is known to have proteolytic and oligosaccharide/polysaccharide-degrading activity (Stewart et al. 1997, Grilli et al. 2016, Jin et al. 2018, Dai et al. 2021). The abundance of <i>Prevotella 1</i> spp. on the surface of Lucerne hay is likely due to their ability to degrade oligosaccharide, hemicellulose, and protein (Cheng et al. 2017, Terry et al. 2020). Given that ~40% of DM was digested during the solubilisation phase of Lucerne hay and no significant NDF and ADF digestion were observed, the abundance of these bacterial genera is likely due to the utilisation of soluble sugars, proteins, and minerals. <a href="#org91ce49f">The adhesion of <i>Prevotella 1</i>, unclassified <i>Christensenellaceae</i>, <i>Butyrivibrio 2</i>, and unclassified <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> has been previously reported on the surface of alfalfa hay during <i>in situ</i> incubation in the rumen.</a><label for="41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="41" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
More similarities. Any differences?
</span>
</p>

<p>
The bacterial communities on Lucerne hay particles in the rapid
digestion phase had significantly higher α-diversity compared to those
in the solubilisation phase, which was accompanied by an increase in the
relative abundance of <i>Treponema 2</i>, <i>Prevotella 1</i>, and <i>Anaeroplasma.</i>
The increased α-diversity is likely due to availability of a wide range
of nutrients such as soluble sugars, proteins, and structural
carbohydrates (hemicellulose, oligosaccharides, and cellulose). The
increased diversity of bacterial community on Lucerne hay after 8 h of
incubation is consistent with previous study on alfalfa hay that showed
the α-diversity increased at 6 h compared to 2 h of incubation and then
remained unchanged between 6 h and 48 h. The diversity of bacterial
communities on Lucerne hay remained unchanged in the slow degradation
and plateau phases which is in line with NDF and ADF digestibility
results. Members of <i>Anaeroplasma</i> metabolise soluble sugars and starch,
and produce acetic acid as the main product. <i>Treponema</i> spp. can
degrade pectin, cellobiose, sucrose, glucose, and fructose (Liu et al.
2016), and their significant increased abundance between 12 h and 48 h
of incubation is due to the utilisation of released sugars as well as
soluble sugars in Lucerne hay. The adhesion of <i>Treponema</i> and
<i>Anaeroplasma</i> has been reported on alfalfa hay (Liu et al. 2016).
Interestingly, <i>Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group</i> and <i>Fibrobacter</i> were
enriched in the slow digestion and plateau phases compared to the rapid
digestion phase which is likely due to increased accessibility of
carbohydrate polymers such as crystalline cellulose. Previous studies
have demonstrated that <i>Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group</i> has a positive
correlation with NDF content. Increased abundance of this bacterial
genus in the slow degradation and plateau phases of Lucerne hay is
likely because of fibre degradation. <i>Ruminococcus 1</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae
XPB1014 group</i>, and <i>Prevotella 1</i> decreased significantly in abundance
in the plateau phase which is consistent with DM, NDF, and ADF
digestibility.

<p>
<a href="#orgd147e48">Previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial communities adherent to fodder particles were affected by fodder type (Koike et al. 2014, Liu et al. 2016, Elliott et al. 2018, Terry et al. 2020). The present study confirms that the chemical composition and structure of fodder significantly affect the bacterial communities associated with fodder particles in the rumen. The bacterial communities colonising Lucerne hay had significantly higher α-diversity than sugarcane bagasse which is likely due to the differences in their chemical composition. Bacterial communities on Lucerne hay and sugarcane bagasse had similar diversity during the first 8 h of incubation but lucerne hay had higher diversity than sugarcane bagasse after 12 h which may be due to complexity of lucerne hay fibre when most of the readily-fermentable components are consumed. It has been previously demonstrated that fodder complexity promotes microbial diversity (Matthews et al. 2019). A comparison of the bacterial genera on sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay particles in the degradation phases of incubation revealed that bacterial taxa detected in the intermediate phase of sugarcane bagasse and slow digestion and plateau phases of Lucerne hay had more specialised microorganisms with cellulytic role. However, the bacterial community on sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay differed in the abundance which might be due to the differences in plant cell wall composition and structure, and/or microbial interaction. A higher abundance of <i>Fibrobacter</i> and <i>Saccharofermentans</i> on sugarcane bagasse is likely because of the low content of soluble and readily digestible carbohydrates, subsequently, fibrolytic bacteria became more dominant. <i>Anaeroplasma</i> and <i>Butyrivibrio 2</i> had a higher abundance in the digestion phase of Lucerne hay which is likely because of the protein, starch, and easily accessible carbohydrates in Lucerne hay. It is reported that <i>Anaeroplasma</i> is more abundant in fodders with high crude protein content (Takizawa et al. 2021).</a><label for="42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="42" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Perhaps this can go closer to the start of the Discussion as it summarises the key findings
</span>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgb24c083">In summary, this study provided a comprehensive overview of the effect of fodder composition on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities colonising sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay and demonstrated that the colonising bacterial community is affected by the differences in crude protein and fibre (NDF and ADF) contents. The dynamics of changes in bacterial communities colonising sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay during <i>in situ</i> rumen incubation is likely driven by ecological niche partitioning, microbial interactions (<i>e.g.</i> hydrogen transfer), and/or competitions between microorganisms for a mutual resource (Moraïs and Mizrahi 2019, Moraïs and Mizrahi 2019). Carbohydrates within plant cell wall are different in terms of rate of degradation which subsequently causes changes in the colonising microbial community over time after feeding. Further, the changes in the relative abundance of different members of bacterial community is likely because fodder fibre becomes increasingly crystalline during digestion. It might also be due to ecological niche modification, a process during which the metabolic activity of microorganisms modifies their local environment and creates new niches for other microorganisms. It is suggested that a rock&#x2013;paper&#x2013;scissor-type interactions might exist in complex ecosystems such as rumen, whereby despite of negative competitions among microorganisms for mutual substrates and growth factors, none microbe become consistently dominant because microorganisms are embedded in networks with multiple environmental factors that allows species coexistence.</a><label for="43" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="43" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span>
The bacterial communities that colonised
sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay were distinct between phases of
incubation. The NDF and ADF digestion of bagasse during the digestion
phase was accompanied by bacterial genera with high cellulolytic
activity and the plateau phase was dominated by bacterial genera that
are mostly involved in the utilisation of degradation products from the
digestion phase. A rapid DM loss in Lucerne hay was accompanied by
bacterial genera that utilise simple carbohydrates and crude protein,
and bacterial taxa shifted to fibrolytic bacteria in the digestion and
plateau phases to metabolise structural carbohydrates. A comparison of
bacterial communities associated with sugarcane bagasse and Lucerne hay
demonstrated that chemical composition of fodder significantly affect
the composition of bacterial communities colonising fodder particles.
These findings are important for the improvement of fodder use
efficiency in ruminants.

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.25" class="footnum" href="#fnr.25">25</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Is it possible to just contrast these findings with the bagasse findings and highlight differences? It all sounds very repetitive the way it is currently written
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.26" class="footnum" href="#fnr.26">26</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
How is this section different to the previous one? Can the important comparisons be incorporated into one section? Primarily focussing on species/genus-level analysis

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.27" class="footnum" href="#fnr.27">27</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Changed from: The proportion of Fibrobacteres was significantly higher in sugarcane bagasse than in Lucerne hay samples at 24 h of incubation, and Lucerne hay had a higher abundance of Tenericutes at 8, 12, and 18 h of incubation than sugarcane bagasse

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.29" class="footnum" href="#fnr.29">29</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Again, this is all quite repetitive. I wonder if this and the previous two sections can be condensed into one, highlighting only the major differences? This will help keep the reader engaged

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.34" class="footnum" href="#fnr.34">34</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
No need to go into so much detail here as that was provided in the results section. Just make a quick reference to the fact that there were big differences in digestibility
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.35" class="footnum" href="#fnr.35">35</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Extra timepoints analysed in this study provided novel insight into phases of digestion that had not previously been observed. This is the key takeaway point and I'm not sure the detail provided before this is necessary to include. Just point the reader to the relevant references
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.36" class="footnum" href="#fnr.36">36</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
This is the key point and just use appropriate references to confirm that your findings are similar to previous ones. No need for all the detail
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.37" class="footnum" href="#fnr.37">37</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
This paragraph basically says that your findings are in agreement with what is already known. That's fine. But is there anything about your particular dataset that is novel? E.g. any novel species-level observation that made use of long Pacbio reads?
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.38" class="footnum" href="#fnr.38">38</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Again, you are highlighting similarities with other studies here. Are there any differences/novel insights?

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.40" class="footnum" href="#fnr.40">40</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Perhaps start a new subsection for lucerne hay. Likewise, make a new sub-section for the sugarcane bagasse section above
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.41" class="footnum" href="#fnr.41">41</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
More similarities. Any differences?
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.42" class="footnum" href="#fnr.42">42</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Perhaps this can go closer to the start of the Discussion as it summarises the key findings
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.43" class="footnum" href="#fnr.43">43</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
The summary should focus on how your approach led to novel insights and how these in turn might have practical applications. You should probably also address limitations such as the lack of analysis of fungi etc. As otherwise this will be picked up by the reviewers
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.44" class="footnum" href="#fnr.44">44</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
The benefits of which were?

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.45" class="footnum" href="#fnr.45">45</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
