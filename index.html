        <h3>Buffel grass</h3>
        <p class="opening paragraph">Cenchrus ciliaris, commonly known as buffel grass, was introduced to Australia in the 1870's, and because of its high nutritional value, hardy nature and tolerance to extreme weather, became a heavily relied upon pastoral species \cite{marshall2012buffel}. Unfortunately, the characteristics that make buffel grass so effective for pasture also provide it with a competitive advantage over native species. That, together with the fact that its rapid growth and spread can fuel intense fires, against which it is better adapted to recover from, means its impact on biodiversity in Australia is potentially devastating. Traditional control methods such as cutting, grazing, burning and herbicide treatments are largely ineffective against mature buffel grass plants due to their tough base and extensive root systems. As such, novel control methods are urgently required.</p>
