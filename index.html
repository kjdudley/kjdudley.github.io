            <div class="articleparagraph">
              <p>Cenchrus ciliaris, commonly known as buffel grass, was introduced to Australia in the 1870's, and because of its high nutritional value, hardy nature and tolerance to extreme weather, became a heavily relied upon pastoral species \cite{marshall2012buffel}. Unfortunately, the characteristics that make buffel grass so effective for pasture also provide it with a competitive advantage over native species. That, together with the fact that its rapid growth and spread can fuel intense fires, against which it is better adapted to recover from, means its impact on biodiversity in Australia is potentially devastating. Traditional control methods such as cutting, grazing, burning and herbicide treatments are largely ineffective against mature buffel grass plants due to their tough base and extensive root systems. As such, novel control methods are urgently required.</p>

            <h1 class="headline">Is temperature-dependent sex determination controlled by epigenetic mechanisms?</h1>
            <img class="article" src="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/figure/image?size=inline&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002447.g001" alt="Temperature induced epigenetic changes in sea bass">
            <div class="articleparagraph">
            <p>Sex ratios in many fish and reptiles are determined by temperature during critical periods of development, often prior to gonad formation. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in this process. In common garden experiments DNA methylation of the Cyp19a gene was <a class="highlight" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002447" target="_blank">shown</a> to be higher in fish exposed to higher temperatures and had a negative effect on expression of the aromatase gene, specifically in gonad tissue. This effect was associated with an increased abundance of males. Similar effects were also shown in <a class="highlight" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063599" target="_blank">red-eared slider turtles</a> and <a class="highlight" href="https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/90/1/2,%201-11/2513929" target="_blank">American alligators</a>.</p>
