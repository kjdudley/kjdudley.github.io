            <h1>The buffel grass conundrum facing Australia</h1>
            <img src="https://nt.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0004/229792/buffel-grass-habit.jpg" alt="Buffel grass">
            <p class="opening paragraph">Cenchrus ciliaris, commonly known as buffel grass, was introduced to Australia in the 1870's, and because of its high nutritional value, hardy nature and tolerance to extreme weather, became a heavily relied upon pastoral species \cite{marshall2012buffel}. Unfortunately, the characteristics that make buffel grass so effective for pasture also provide it with a competitive advantage over native species. That, together with the fact that its rapid growth and spread can fuel intense fires, against which it is better adapted to recover from, means its impact on biodiversity in Australia is potentially devastating. Traditional control methods such as cutting, grazing, burning and herbicide treatments are largely ineffective against mature buffel grass plants due to their tough base and extensive root systems. As such, novel control methods are urgently required.</p>

            <h1>Are marine organisms controlled by epigenetic mechanisms too?</h1>
            <img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/figure/image?size=inline&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002447.g001" alt="Temperature induced epigenetic changes in sea bass">
            <p>Sex ratios in many fish and reptiles are determined by temperature during critical periods of gonad development. Evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in this process, i.e. prior to gonad development. DNA methylation of the Cyp19a gene was shown to be higher in fish exposed to higher temperatures and had a negative effect on expression of the aromatase gene <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002447" target="_blank">(Navarro-Mart{\'\i}n et al. 2011)</a>. This effect was particularly prevalent in females.</p>
