Hello from sunny Brisbane! It's the start of a new year and I'm really excited about getting this site up and running. Over the last decade, since completing my PhD in the UK, I have found myself navigating the choppy waters of early career research, first in New Zealand, and now in Australia. In my [current role](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/dudleyk/ "Kevin Dudley QUT staff profile") as Genomics Research Officer at the **Queensland University of Technology (QUT)** I am fortunate enough to work with some great people who have provided me with the opportunity to foster my own independent research in an area I find truly inspiring.

The main aim of this site is to share my experiences as I continue my journey through the perilous, yet highly rewarding landscape that is a career in academic research. I will focus on the pursuits that consume most of my time, which at present include designing and implementing genomics experiments, producing large sequencing datasets and attempting to analyse these. Developing the computational skills necessary to **manage**, **access**, **process** and **analyse** such large amounts of data has been one of my steepest learning curves and I am extremely grateful for the many excellent [**resources**]({{site.baseurl}}/resources.html "goto resources section") out there that have helped me along the way. I hope my sharing of these experiences will be of use for people who find themselves in similar circumstances.

The second aim I have for this site is to provide a spotlight for the research activities I have been and am currently involved with. This is not due to some pent up desire to inflate my own ego, nor indeed to inflate my citation count (although that would be a useful side-effect!). Rather, I feel that by putting it all out there, so to speak, I am opening myself up to criticism (both self and from others) that will be an effective mechanism for increasing the quality of my research going forward. Over the coming months I will begin to reassess the key publications I have contributed towards that define the research I am most passionate about. I hope this self appraisal will be interesting for people who venture onto this site and as always I am eager to hear your thoughts.
