Hello from sunny Brisbane! It's the start of a new year and I'm excited to be getting going with this site. Over the last decade, since completing my PhD in the UK, I've found myself navigating the choppy waters of early career research, first in New Zealand, and now in Australia. In my [current role](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/dudleyk/ "Kevin Dudley QUT staff profile") as Genomics Research Officer at the **Queensland University of Technology (QUT)** I'm fortunate enough to work with some great people who have provided me with the opportunity to foster my own independent research in an area I find truly inspiring.

The main aim of this site is to share my experiences as I continue my journey through the perilous, yet highly rewarding landscape that is a career in academic research. I will focus on the pursuits that consume most of my time, which at present involves designing and implementing genomics experiments, producing large amounts of sequencing data, and attempting to analyse these data. Developing the computational skills necessary to **manage**, **access**, **process** and **analyse** such large datasets has been one of my steepest learning curves, and I am extremely grateful for the many excellent **resources** out there that have helped me along the way. I hope that by sharing my experiences on this site it will be useful for people in a similar situation.

The second aim I have for this site is to provide a backdrop for the research activities I have been, and am currently, involved in. This is not due to some pent up need to inflate my own ego, nor indeed to inflate my citation count (although that would be a useful side-effect!). Rather, I feel that putting it all out there so to speak, and being open to criticism (both self and from others) is an effective mechanism for increasing quality of research going forward.
